      <h2>DURING:</h2>
      <h4> (DROP, COVER and HOLD ON!)</h4>
      <h3>Indoors:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Move as little as possible - most injuries during earthquakes occur because of people moving around, falling and suffering sprains, fractures and head injuries.</li>
        <li>Try to protect your head and torso.</li>
        <li>Doorways are no stronger than any other part of a structure so don’t rely on them for protection! During an earthquake, get under a sturdy piece of furniture and hold on.</li>
        <li>If you are in bed, stay there, curl up and hold on, and cover your head.</li>
        <li>Stay indoors until the shaking stops and you are sure it is safe to exit.</li>
        <li>If you must leave a building after the shaking stops, use stairs rather than an elevator in case of aftershocks, power outages or other damage.</li>
        <li>Be aware that smoke alarms and sprinkler systems frequently go off in buildings during an earthquake, even if there is no fire.</li>
        <li>If you smell gas, get out of the house and move as far away as possible.</li>
        <li>Before you leave any building check to make sure that there is no debris from the building that could fall on you.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Outdoors:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Find a clear spot and drop to the ground. Stay there until the shaking stops.</li>
        <li>Try to get as far away from buildings, power lines, trees, and streetlights as possible.</li>
        <li>If you're in a vehicle, pull over to a clear location and stop. Avoid bridges, overpasses and power lines if possible.</li>
        <li>Stay inside with your seatbelt fastened until the shaking stops.</li>
        <li>After the shaking has stopped, drive on carefully, avoiding bridges and ramps that may have been damaged.</li>
        <li>If a power line falls on your vehicle, do not get out. Wait for assistance.</li>
        <li>If you are in a mountainous area or near unstable slopes or cliffs, be alert for falling rocks and other debris as well as <a href="https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/landslide.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-aa-link-button="landslides">landslides</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>AFTER:</h2>
      <h4>(Staying Safe After an Earthquake)</h4>
      <h3>If you do nothing else:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>If away from home, return only when authorities say it is safe to do so.</li>
        <li>Check yourself for injuries and get first aid, if necessary, before helping injured or trapped persons.</li>
        <li>After an earthquake, the disaster may continue. Expect and prepare for potential aftershocks, landslides or even a tsunami if you live on a coast.</li>
        <li>Each time you feel an aftershock, DROP, COVER and HOLD ON. Aftershocks frequently occur minutes, days, weeks and even months following an earthquake.</li>
        <li>Look for and extinguish small fires. Fire is the most common hazard after an earthquake.</li>
      </ol>
